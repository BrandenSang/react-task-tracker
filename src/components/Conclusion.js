            <p><br></br>Overall, the experience of coding in ReactJs and Nodejs with express proved to be difficult! While difficult, it was also fun. As stated in the information page,
                the documentation on React was not very good in terms of new ways to do things. For example, the video I used to learn how to code in React was made in January of 2021, but in
                November/December 2021 there were quite a few changes to be made as some methods implemented in January were changed and did not work the same. As for NodeJs and Express, it was difficult to
                start, but got easier when practiced. My rating of difficulty for ReactJs (as a person who did noot know how to do anything in ReactJs before hand) is 7.5/10, purely because of the functional changes
                when updated. My rating of difficulty for NodeJs and Express are 6.5/10 when trying to connect it to ReactJs apps and have it work properly.
                <br></br><br></br>In terms of working as expected, React exceeded my expectations and it worked better than expected! NodeJs and Express were not as easy to implement so it underperformed in terms of what I expected.
                ReactJs and NodeJs with Express were definetly a challenge to configure for the previously mentioned reasons. However, installation was a breeze.
                <br></br><br></br>In terms of creating pages, ReactJs was awesome for that! It was really easy to implement multiple pages once I did it one time. I provided that in my tutorial page on how to create a nice looking page.
                With the Link library on React, it was quite simple to create multuiple pages without having any extra external files. It could be contained in one app to provide easy navigation and no reloading what-so-ever!
                <br></br><br></br>The learning curve for ReactJs was only steep because of the newly updated version. Other than that, the transition from HTML and Javascript were like bread and butter. Since ReactJs is built upon
                the Javascript libraries and more, it was not a challenge in that respect.
                <br></br><br></br>In terms of doing things differently, yes I would have. Not with ReactJs, though. ReactJs was fun to learn and get working so creating it in ReactJs would be the same. However, interms of backend,
                I would have liked to explore a different one, as it might have been easier/more fun to develop in.
                <br></br><br></br>At the end of the day however, I do not regret the choices of frameworks and am rather greatful I got to explore ReactJs!
